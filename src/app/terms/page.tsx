              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">1. By using Velora, you agree to these terms</h2>
              <p>
                When you connect your wallet and use Velora, you&apos;re agreeing to follow these terms. If something here doesn&apos;t work for you, we&apos;d ask that you not use the platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                These terms cover the website, the dashboard, support pages, and everything else we make available under the Velora name.

            <div className="space-y-3">
              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">2. Your account is your responsibility</h2>
              <p>
                You&apos;re in charge of your wallet, your device, and your recovery phrase. We can&apos;t access or restore your wallet if something goes wrong on your end — that&apos;s by design, not by accident. It&apos;s what keeps the system secure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Always double-check what you&apos;re approving in your wallet. Take your time with prompts. If something feels off, stop and ask us.

              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">3. How the platform works</h2>
              <p>
                Velora allows you to activate your account with a one-time deposit. Once activated, you get access to your personal dashboard where you can invite others, track your community&apos;s growth, and manage your account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rewards are distributed automatically based on community activity. All parameters — including activation amounts, reward percentages, and timelines — are configurable by the platform and may be adjusted as needed.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="space-y-3">
              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">4. Play fair</h2>
              <p>
                Don&apos;t try to game the system, spam other users, create fake accounts, or do anything that hurts the experience for others. We&apos;re building this for honest people who want a fair shot.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we see activity that looks abusive or harmful, we may limit or block that account. We&apos;d rather keep the community clean than let bad actors ruin it.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="space-y-3">
              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">5. Withdrawals and fees</h2>
              <p>
                You can withdraw your rewards from your internal balance. There&apos;s a minimum withdrawal amount and a processing fee — both are visible in your dashboard settings. These help cover transaction costs and keep the platform running.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="space-y-3">
              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">6. Things can change</h2>
              <p>
                We&apos;re constantly improving Velora. That means these terms, platform features, and system parameters may evolve over time. We&apos;ll always try to give you a heads-up, but continued use means you&apos;re okay with the latest version.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="space-y-3">
              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">7. No guarantees & Market Risk</h2>
              <p>
                Like any platform, Velora is provided as-is. We work hard to keep things running smoothly, but we can&apos;t promise zero downtime or that every feature will work perfectly at all times. Technology has its days.

                Additionally, please be aware that cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Participation involves significant market risk, and the value of digital assets can fluctuate widely. You should never participate with funds you cannot afford to lose.
